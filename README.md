# SQL-Case-Study-on-DepEd-Schools-Masterlist

## <br>Overview

This project uses the S.Y. 2020-2021 DepEd Schools Masterlist that contains 64,000+ schools in the Philippines to demonstrate **SQL database creation**, **data cleaning**, and **analysis**.

## <br>Dataset
**Source:** [data.gov.ph](https://data.gov.ph/index/public/dataset/SY%202020-2021%20Masterlist%20of%20Schools/5dpij7nd-uhrj-wk5l-xv2h-q5pgkiccv9ag)
**<br>Size:** (60924, 13)
**<br>Key Fields:** `region`, `division`, `municipality`, `sector`, `urban_rural_classification`, `school_subclassification`

## <br>Project Workflow
1. **Data Extraction and Preprocessing (Python)**
   - Extracted raw data from PDF using Python (pdfplumber).
   - Cleaned and standardized data using Pandas:
      - Corrected inconsistencies in municipality, sector, and classification fields.
      - Reformatted text cases and standardized identifiers.
   - Load cleaned dataset to PostgreSQL (`masterlist` table)
2. **Database Design** 
   - Used a denormalized table structure to simplify querying and improve performance for analysis.
   - Columns include:
`region`, `division`, `district`, `school_name`, `municipality`, `barangay`,
`sector`, `urban_rural_classification`, `school_subclassification`, and others.

1. **SQL Analysis**
   - Used SQL to query and analyze data.
   - Example analyses:
     - Top regions and divisions by number of schools.
     - Comparison between public vs. private schools.
     - Ratio for public and private schools per sector.
     - Classification of schools by sector and location.

## <br>Key SQL Analyses

| Question                                  | Query Insight                             |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Regions by No. of Schools | - `Region IV-A` leads with 6300+ schools <br>- `CAR` had the fewest schools: only 2000+              |
| Public vs. Private Ratio | - `78.24%` public and `21.76%` private schools are there in the Philippines <br>- `1:2.7` that for every public school, there are ~3 private schools in NCR <br>- `15.02:1` that for every private school, there are ~15 public schools in Region-VIII
| Urban vs. Rural Schools | - `78.14%` in partially urbanized, `17.08%` in urban, and `4.78%` in rural areas <br>- In urban areas, `60.03%` of schools are private <br>- In partially urbanized and rural areas, `85.61%` and `94.47%` of schools are public, respectively
| Top Curricular Offering Classification | `71.84%` or `43700+` out of all schools are `Purely ES`
| Municipality with Zero Public School | Every `municipality` listed in the DepEd Masterlist has at least one public school
| Most School Classification per Region | - `62.67%` of schools are `non-sectarian` in NCR <br>- `78.07%` of schools are `DepED managed` in Region-VI

## <br>Sample Queries
**a. Public vs. Private Ratio per Sector**
```sql
SELECT
    urban_rural,
    SUM(CASE WHEN sector IN ('Public', 'SUCs/LUCs') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS public_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN sector = 'Private' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS private_count,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN sector IN ('Public', 'SUCs/LUCs') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric/SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(PARTITION BY urban_rural) * 100,2) AS public_percentage,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN sector = 'Private' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric/SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(PARTITION BY urban_rural) * 100,2) AS private_percentage,
    CONCAT(ROUND(
            SUM(CASE WHEN sector IN ('Public', 'SUCs/LUCs') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric/
            SUM(CASE WHEN sector = 'Private' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 2
        ), ' : 1') AS public_private_ratio
FROM masterlist
GROUP BY urban_rural;
```

**b. Most common school classification per region**
```sql
WITH rank_type AS (
    SELECT
        region,
        school_subclassification,
        COUNT(*) as total_count,
        ROUND(COUNT(*)/SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(PARTITION BY region) * 100,2) AS percentage,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY region ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC)
    FROM masterlist
    GROUP BY region, school_subclassification
    ORDER BY region ASC, total_count DESC
)
SELECT 
    region,
    school_subclassification,
    percentage,
    total_count
FROM rank_type
WHERE rank = 1
ORDER BY region ASC;
```
**c. Total no. of schools in masterlist**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM masterlist;
```
## <br>Tools and Technologies
   - Python (pandas, pdfplumber, sqlalchemy)
   - PostgreSQL / SQL
   - Excel (for initial validation)

## <br>Notes

- The dataset is SY 2020–2021 DepEd Masterlist.
- Being denormalized, the table is easier for read-heavy queries but may have redundancy.
- Data cleaning may be required for street address.
